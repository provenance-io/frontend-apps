## To Do
  - Menu items listen for permissions and change title (ex: create a wallet vs view wallet)
    - Just like tiles
  - Tablet View
  - Mobile View

## Startup Commands
  `npm start` - Start the app locally on port 3000 (Should open automatically, but you can manually visit http://localhost:3006/)

  `npm run build` - Build the production version and bundle the app.  Typically used in the pipeline for deploys.
